              <p class="title-text">Overview</p>
              <p>CTPL: Education aims to design a smarter learning future for Peru. Over the course of a three-day hands-on workshop, educators, thinkers, and technologists will work with MIT researchers to produce concepts and prototypes that can be implemented at scale to improve the quality of education and the experiences of educators and learners across the country. We define “education” broadly, imagining creative solutions for K-12, higher education, and informal learning alike.</p>
              <p>The CTPL Mission:
<ul>
<li>Develop innovative tools and content to address specific learning and education challenges</li>
<li>Share skills and strategies that local participants can implement across their work</li>
<li>Connect participants in similar domain to each other and to global networks of practitioners</li>
<li>Lay the foundations for an educational technology community based in Lima, Peru</li>
</ul>

            <p> An open call for participants will be circulated in Lima, with the objective of assembling a group of 20-30 people, working in teams around pre-existing projects or ideas.</p>
            <p>Facilitators will work to select highly promising proposals from a broad range of interest areas, so that the group is informed by a wide range of experiences and can engage with diverse strengths and needs.</p>
            <p>Participating groups and projects will be expected to have a concrete theme or idea to work on during the sessions, and to commit to attending both full-day workshops and the public showcase event. This will be emphasized in the call for participants, where applicants will be expected to describe their idea or project, their target audience, their expectations and interests, and the key challenges they're facing. Participation in the CIPL is entirely free of charge.</p>

            <b>Chelsea Barabas</b></br>Chelsea researches how the landscape of higher education is evolving to meet the high demand for creative technologists in the U.S. workforce. She is particularly interested in understanding how informal learning experiences translate into meaningful career opportunities in the tech sector, where rapid industry growth has outpaced the supply of skilled technical and creative talent. Chelsea’s work has led her to engage with experimental education programs around the world that are designed to provide students who lack access to traditional degree programs with the opportunity to develop in-demand skills. Her research also examines how the competencies that students develop in these less formalized learning programs are validated and valued in the job market. Through this work, Chelsea hopes to provide a vision for how the ecosystem of higher education can be expanded to meet the needs of a diverse set of learners interested in working in the emerging innovation economy. Prior to coming to MIT, Chelsea worked and lived in East Africa, South America and the Middle East, where she developed co-learning workshops for highly diverse groups of people from around the world.
